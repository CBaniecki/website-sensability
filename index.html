            <p>
                The goal for Medo by Sensability is to maintain a tangible association with music, which can improve the cognitive function through touch. The textures establish an association to the notes in the music alongside the music visualization. 
            </p>

            <p>
                Sensability assists accomodations to music therapy as an (alternative) service. (With/By) subscribing, there is an (option/opportunity) to connect with a music therapist.
